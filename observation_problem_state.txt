I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on tsp problem:
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the challenge of finding the shortest possible route that visits a given list of cities exactly once and returns to the origin city, based on the distances between each pair of cities.


Please consider is tsp a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***is_cop:yes/no***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.

***is_cop:yes***

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. It involves finding the optimal permutation (order) of cities to visit, which is a combinatorial structure. Due to its NP-hard nature, it is commonly solved using heuristics (e.g., nearest neighbor, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization) and metaheuristics, including hyper-heuristics. Therefore, it fits perfectly within the domain of combinatorial optimization problems addressed by heuristic methods.

We aim to collaboratively create the functions to generate some problem states(statistics data), which captures the high-level features of problem instance for the tsp. 

These functions will be underpinned by rigorous statistical analysis and domain-specific knowledge, ensuring they are both accurate and relevant.


In determining the optimal problem states to represent instance, we must adhere to the following criteria:
1. The data representation should be succinct to minimize computational load while retaining sufficient granularity to recognize the feature of the problem and solution.
2. It must incorporate unique attributes that aid in the clear distinction between different instances.
3. The most important, these data only focus on instance and has nothing to do with solution.

Now, please tell me which statistical data are best serve as instance problem state.

Based on your requirements for the TSP, here are the statistical features that best characterize a problem instance, independent of any solution.

***instance_problem_state:
num_cities;len(coordinate_list);The fundamental size parameter of the instance, directly defining the size of the search space (n!).
avg_distance;mean(all_unique_pairwise_distances);Captures the central tendency of the distance matrix, indicating the general scale of the problem.
std_distance;std(all_unique_pairwise_distances);Measures the dispersion of distances. A high value indicates a mix of very short and very long edges, affecting problem structure.
min_distance;min(all_unique_pairwise_distances);The shortest possible edge length, which can be critical for constructing greedy solutions.
max_distance;max(all_unique_pairwise_distances);The longest possible edge length, indicating the potential penalty for poor edge choices.
avg_nearest_neighbor_dist;for each city, find its distance to the closest other city, then average these values;Indicates how clustered the cities are on average. A low value suggests tight clusters.
centroid_std;calculate the centroid (mean_x, mean_y) of all cities, then compute the std of distances from each city to this centroid;Measures the spread of the cities around the center. Low std implies a circular cluster, high std implies an elongated or multi-cluster instance.
distance_matrix_skew;scipy.stats.skew(distance_matrix.flatten());Quantifies the asymmetry of the distance distribution. Positive skew indicates many short distances and a few very long ones.
distance_matrix_kurtosis;scipy.stats.kurtosis(distance_matrix.flatten());Measures the "tailedness" of the distance distribution. High kurtosis suggests a distribution with heavier tails (more outliers) than a normal distribution.

Now, we aim to collaboratively create the functions to generate some problem states(statistics data), which captures the high-level features of current (partial) solution for the tsp.

These functions will be underpinned by rigorous statistical analysis and domain-specific knowledge, ensuring they are both accurate and relevant.


In determining the optimal problem states to represent instance, we must adhere to the following criteria:
1. The data representation should be succinct to minimize computational load while retaining sufficient granularity to recognize the solution feature.
2. It must incorporate unique attributes that aid in the clear distinction between different solution stage.
3. We need to evaluate the current status from multiple dimensions, including the current progress of the solution, the quality of the solution, the status of the remaining data, etc.

**Analysis**: These 8 core metrics capture the essential dynamics of solution evolution. `current_tour_length` and `current_to_optimal_ratio` track solution quality. `percent_complete` and `unvisited_nodes_count` measure progress. `avg_edge_length_current` and `std_edge_length_current` monitor edge selection patterns. `avg_distance_to_unvisited` and `connectivity_quality` assess expansion potential from the current solution state. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of solution development while remaining computationally efficient.
